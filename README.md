# Mathematical figures

Mathematical figures I have made, mostly in InkScape. 
Feel free to use anything you wantm as you please. 


## pdf_tex
Some of the files are meant to use with LaTeX, so they contain mathematical writing. 
You will see these by being encompassed by dollar signs, $...$.
These are used to let LaTeX compile the mathematical writing, in order to have it in the same style as the rest of the document.

Todo: Make a guide on how to use them
